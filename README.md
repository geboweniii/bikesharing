# Overview
The purpose of thsi effort is to determine whether investing in a Des Moines based bike rental business is worthwhile. New York bike rental data from CitiBike was used as a basis for this analysis.

Key stakeholders have requested an analysis based on trip duration data collected in the month of August. The purpose of the analysis is to determine when bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are most popular for bike rental. The data collected from CitiBike required modifications using a Jupyter file in order to convert trip duration to hours, minutes and seconds. A new CSV was created and imported into Tableau for the development of visualizations.
