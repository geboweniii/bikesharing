# Overview
The purpose of thsi effort is to determine whether investing in a Des Moines based bike rental business is worthwhile. New York bike rental data from CitiBike was used as a basis for this analysis.

Key stakeholders have requested an analysis based on trip duration data collected in the month of August. The purpose of the analysis is to determine when bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are most popular for bike rental. The data collected from CitiBike required modifications using a Jupyter file in order to convert trip duration to hours, minutes and seconds. A new CSV was created and imported into Tableau for the development of visualizations.

# Summary
Bike rental appears to be a viable business venture in additional cities based on the data collected assuming the demographics and weather conditions are comparable. Additional analysis may be required to identify the viability of a bike rental business in cold weather months such as January or February. Futher analysis based on median household income would also be of value.
